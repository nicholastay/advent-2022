# advent-2022

Probably C++ this time? Might mix it up though, who knows.

## Build

For the C++, e.g.:

```shell
# To build day01
$ ./adv b day01

# To build and run day01 and run it with txt file as arg
$ ./adv r day01 day01/example.txt

# To create a new day skeleton 'day123'
$ ./adv c day123
```
